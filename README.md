# liir

## Overview

**liir** is a simple [REPL (Read, eval, print and loop)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) system developed in C. LIIR stands for `Leia, interprete, imprima e repita` which is the brazilian portuguese translation for the english acronym `Read, eval, print and loop - REPL`. 
This project posseses the following characteristics:

- Developed with C11;
- This code was tested only on Linux (compiled with GNU GCC);
- It uses the library [arguments](https://github.com/ClecioJung/arguments) to parse command line arguments;
- It accepts the following command line arguments:
    - The option `--help` or `-h` displays the help message;
    - The option `--token` or `-t` displays the list of tokens generated by lexical analysis at each step;
    - The option `--ast` or `-a` displays the abstract syntax tree (AST) generated by the parser at each step;
    - The option `--variable` or `-v` displays the variables list at each step;
    - The option `--function` or `-v` displays the built-in functions;
- All the operations are performed with `double` precision floating point numbers (64 bits);
- Implemented binary operators:
    - Adition (`+`);
    - Subtraction (`-`);
    - Multiplication (`*`);
    - Division (`/`);
    - Exponentiation (`^`);
- Implemented unary operators:
    - Minus sign (`-`);
